# SolidWorks Designs for EEZYbotARM Servo Motors

This folder contains all the SolidWorks parts and assemblies for the servo
motors used in the EEZYbotARM.

## What's Included?
- **Parts    (.SLDPRT)** – Individual components of the servo motor.
- **Assembly (.SLDASM)** – The complete servo motor assembly.

## How to Contribute
I welcome contributions to improve the design! While I strive for precision,
my background is in electrical engineering, and I have limited experience with
SolidWorks. If you have expertise in CAD modeling, your help in refining this
design would be greatly appreciated.

Areas for improvement include:
- Enhancing the servo motor design for greater accuracy to the real-world
  component, such as:
- Improving the gear design for better functionality and realism;
- Refining screw hole placements for proper alignment;
- Correcting any measurement inaccuracies or other details that could improve
  fidelity.

If you spot any issues or have suggestions, feel free to submit a pull request
or open an issue!
